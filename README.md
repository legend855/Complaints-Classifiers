# Complaints-Classifiers
Testing word classification by novel machine learning methods on a complaints dataset 

## Description

These are implementations of Logistic regression, an svm, boosted trees and random forests tested on a complaints dataset not yet publicly available. 

Testing is done with a 25% held out set. The first 400 complaints are manually annotated by humans and the remaining 2000 were annotated by an algorithm whose parameters were manually hand designed. 
The team claim to have achieved a baseline 0.9 F1 score. The SVM, boosted trees and random forests achieve an average 0.8 F1 score. 
Hopefully application of a deep learning NLP method will achieve a new baseline (in the works).


### p.s: Dataset is not public yet, so my code may not be quite useful...yet
